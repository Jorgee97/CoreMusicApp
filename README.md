# CoreMusicApp

This is an app created for practise android development, the code is not clean (my apologies).

# Features 
Actually the app does this:
- List all songs on the device.
- Reproduce any song.
- Basic music app functions available. I mean prev, next, play, pause.

# Future features 
- Albums fragment. (it is there, but does nothing)
- Notification control.
- Widget control.
- Custom themes.

# Notes and comments
This app is open source, you can used as a starting point to understand how MediaStore works, how to use a service, a broadcast, how to
cast variables, how to create parcelable objects, there is also some usage of RxJava. 

I have to tell that the code is not that clean, and I will be working any time soon to fix and mantaine the code.

# Libraries that I used here
- Glide
- RxJava
- Butterknife
